## Important Note: Early Submission for Discussion

We are submitting Milestone 3 in its current state to initiate the review discussion, despite **security hardening and comprehensive testing** being the final remaining deliverables.

**Why we decided to submit now:**

1. **Near-Complete State** - The platform is functionally complete with all core features operational
2. **Transparency** - We want reviewers to see our current progress and provide feedback while we finalize the remaining work
3. **Parallel Development** - Starting the discussion allows us to incorporate reviewer feedback into our security hardening process
4. **Commitment to Completion** - We are actively working on the remaining deliverables and will update this PR with the completed deliverables template upon finalization

**Remaining Work:**
- [ ] Comprehensive security audit and hardening
- [ ] End-to-end testing documentation
- [ ] Final testing guide updates

We will attach the finished deliverables template to this PR the moment security hardening and testing are complete. We appreciate the committee's understanding and welcome any preliminary feedback.
